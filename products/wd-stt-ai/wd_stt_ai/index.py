"""Making transcripts searchable (ADR-0041, ADR-0043): the words that are indexed, and the source
the platform pages through to backfill the index and clean it up. Only finished ones are indexed.

The index holds the first part of a long transcript (the embedder reads about 6000 characters);
indexing a long one in several pieces is a planned change (ADR-0043)."""
