# SSE event contract

Status: **Finalised (Phase 1)**. Changes need an ADR. The Pydantic models in `packages/contracts` (`wd_contracts/events.py`) are the source of truth;
this doc describes them. TypeScript types are generated into `packages/contracts-ts` with
`make contracts`.

## Transport

- `POST /products/{product_id}/runs` starts a run and returns `text/event-stream`.
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/events` reconnects to an existing run. Supports `Last-Event-ID`; the
  server replays events after that sequence number.
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/resume` answers an `interrupt` (approve, edit) and continues the
  stream.
- The Next.js BFF passes the upstream stream through unchanged: return the upstream
  `ReadableStream`, disable compression and buffering.
- Heartbeat comment (`: ping`) every 15 s to keep proxies from closing idle streams.

## Envelope

Each SSE message:

```
id: <seq>
event: <type>
data: <json>
```

Every `data` object includes:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `run_id` | string (UUID) | |
| `thread_id` | string (UUID) | Conversation / song thread |
| `seq` | int | Monotonic per run; also the SSE `id` |
| `ts` | string | ISO 8601 UTC |

## Event types

| Event | When | Payload fields (besides envelope) |
|---|---|---|
| `node` | A graph node starts or finishes | `node`, `status` (`started` \| `completed`), `label` (human-readable) |
| `token` | LLM output streams | `node`, `text` (delta) |
| `interrupt` | Graph pauses for the user | `interrupt_id`, `kind` (e.g. `approve_lyrics`), `payload` (editable data) |
| `job_progress` | Media job state changes | `job_id`, `capability`, `status` (`queued` \| `running` \| `completed` \| `failed`), `queue_position?`, `progress?` (0–1), `preview_url?` |
| `error` | Recoverable or fatal error | `code`, `message` (user-safe), `retryable` (bool), `job_id?` |
| `done` | Run finished | `outputs` (product-specific, e.g. `{title, lyrics, audio_url, cover_url}`) |

Rules:

- `done` and fatal `error` are terminal; the server closes the stream after them.
- Asset fields are always URLs (pre-signed or served by the API), never bytes.
- `message` fields never contain stack traces or internal hostnames.
- New optional fields may be added without an ADR. Renaming or removing fields, or adding
  event types, needs one.

## Example

```
id: 1
event: node
data: {"run_id":"…","thread_id":"…","seq":1,"ts":"…","node":"write_lyrics","status":"started","label":"Writing lyrics"}

id: 2
event: token
data: {"run_id":"…","thread_id":"…","seq":2,"ts":"…","node":"write_lyrics","text":"[verse]\n"}

id: 40
event: interrupt
data: {"run_id":"…","thread_id":"…","seq":40,"ts":"…","interrupt_id":"…","kind":"approve_lyrics","payload":{"title":"…","lyrics":"…"}}

id: 41
event: job_progress
data: {"run_id":"…","thread_id":"…","seq":41,"ts":"…","job_id":"…","capability":"music.generate","status":"queued","queue_position":2}

id: 57
event: done
data: {"run_id":"…","thread_id":"…","seq":57,"ts":"…","outputs":{"title":"…","lyrics":"…","audio_url":"https://…","cover_url":"https://…"}}
```

## Phase 1 implementation notes

- The event log per run is held **in the API process**, so reconnect (`Last-Event-ID`) only
  works against the same replica. Redis pub/sub fan-out replaces this in Phase 4.
- A stream closes after `done`, `error`, or an `interrupt` that is the latest event;
  `POST /runs/{run_id}/resume` continues the same run with the next `seq`.
- Runs are scoped to the resolving identity (stub user in dev); other users get 404.
