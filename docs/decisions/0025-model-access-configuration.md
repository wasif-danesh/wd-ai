# ADR-0025: Model access configuration (local by default, admin-configurable)

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Replaces:** the earlier draft "Hosted inference: no GPU in the cloud or home lab" (never accepted)

## Context

Every environment (dev, staging, production) should default to local models. An admin should be able
to change, from a UI, how LLMs and media models are reached: hosted LLM providers (Gemini, Groq,
Cerebras, OpenRouter, or any other LiteLLM-supported one) and media providers (local ComfyUI,
Comfy Cloud, OpenRouter, or others). Graphs already ask for capabilities and LiteLLM aliases
(rules 4 and 5), and the media worker already owns generation (rule 6), so graph and product code
should not change.

## Research (2026-10-08, vendor pages and search results; re-verify before building)

- **Comfy Cloud API:** runs API-format workflows at `https://cloud.comfy.org` with an `X-API-Key`
  header. Needs a paid subscription. Credits are charged for active GPU time. v1 is deprecated in
  favour of Comfy API v2. Inputs and outputs are kept 24 hours, so results must be copied to our
  storage at once. Unconfirmed: that it has our exact model files, credits per song, concurrency
  limits, commercial-use terms.
- **Free LLM tiers:** Gemini's free tier may use prompts to improve Google products and cannot serve
  users in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. Groq and Cerebras free tiers are for prototyping
  (about 30 requests per minute).

## Decision (proposed)

1. **Local by default where hardware exists** (dev machines, home lab). On a cloud cluster with no
   GPU the platform starts "not configured": health checks say so and runs fail with a clear,
   typed error until an admin binds a provider.
2. **Aliases stay the contract.** The admin maps each LiteLLM alias (`default-chat`,
   `lyrics-writer`, `moderator`, `multimodal`, `embedder`) to a provider and model. The UI drives
   LiteLLM's model-management API, so "any provider" needs no code of our own.
3. **Media adapters.** One small interface per capability (`image.generate`, `music.generate`).
   Adapters: local ComfyUI, Comfy Cloud (reuses our workflows and map files), and a generic
   OpenAI-compatible images adapter. Each other provider needs its own adapter that translates
   our request (prompt, size, seed, duration) to that provider's parameters. Jobs carry the
   capability, not the provider; the worker resolves the active provider at run time and records
   which one it used in the usage event.
4. **Config storage.** Env vars and Helm values seed the defaults; admin overrides live in Postgres
   (tenant- and product-scoped, rule 7). An export and import as YAML makes drift from Git visible.
   This **amends rule 13** ("config only from env vars") for provider bindings only.
5. **API keys** are stored encrypted with a master key from the secrets manager or env, are
   write-only (never returned by the API, never logged), and are shown only as "set / not set".
6. **Moderation is protected.** A new or changed `moderator` binding goes live only after a canary
   set of must-refuse and must-allow cases passes (ADR-0022 evaluation cases). Fail closed stays.
7. **Provider metadata** on each binding: whether the provider trains on data (the UI warns about
   free tiers and blocks them in production), price per token or job (feeds `cost_usd` on usage
   events and billing), fallback order, and a budget limit with a circuit breaker.
8. **Admin access** needs authentication and an admin role first, an audit log of every change
   (who, what, when; no secrets), and a "test connection" action per binding.
9. **Provider approval** (rule 12): Comfy Cloud and hosted LLM providers are proprietary services;
   this ADR records the approval once accepted.
10. **GPU on k3s (Phase 4)** stays valid for the home lab; it is no longer required for the cloud.

## Open questions

- Do Comfy Cloud's models match our workflows? Test with a paid key before accepting.
- Which hosted LLM first, after the guardrail evaluation (suggested: paid Gemini)?

## Consequences

- No product or graph code changes; the work is the admin UI, config store, adapters and canary.
- Runtime config is not in Git, so staging and production state needs the YAML export and an audit log.
- User ideas and lyrics reach third parties when hosted providers are used; the privacy policy must say so.
