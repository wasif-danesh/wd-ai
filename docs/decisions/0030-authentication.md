# ADR-0030: Authentication (Auth.js sign-in, signed API tokens)

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Builds on:** ADR-0011 (identity seam)

## Context

Every request already resolves an `Identity` (rule 8), but it is a stub user. Real users need to
sign in with Google, GitHub or Microsoft. The admin section (ADR-0025), billing (ADR-0029) and
analytics (ADR-0027) all depend on a stable, trustworthy user id. The browser never calls the API
directly (BFF), and the API must not trust anything the browser can forge.

## Decision

- **Sign-in in the web app with Auth.js v5**, JWT session cookie, no database adapter. Google,
  GitHub and Microsoft Entra ID are each enabled only when their client id and secret are set.
- **The BFF mints a short-lived API token per request.** After checking the Auth.js session, the
  route handler (or server component) signs an HS256 JWT (`iss=wd-web`, `aud=wd-api`, five-minute
  expiry) and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`. Claims: `sub` = `<provider>:<account id>`,
  `email`, `email_verified`, `name`, `picture`. The shared secret (`API_AUTH_SECRET`, at least 32
  bytes) is separate from `AUTH_SECRET`. The Auth.js cookie is never forwarded. Moving to asymmetric
  keys (API holds only the public key) is a later change with no API shape impact.
- **The API owns users.** Users and identities belong to a tenant, not to a product: a person signs in
  once for every product (an exception to "every table carries `product_id`"; product data is scoped by
  `user_id`). Migration 0005 replaces the empty, product-scoped `users` placeholder from 0001.
   On a valid token it resolves or creates a row in `users` and
  `user_identities` (migration 0005) and returns `Identity(tenant_id, user_id, role)`. `user_id` is
  our own UUID, stable across providers; tenant stays the default tenant for now. No endpoint
  changes, so every existing route is protected by the same dependency.
- **Account linking is conservative.** A new provider identity joins an existing user only when
  **both** emails are verified and equal. Only Google reports `email_verified`; GitHub and
  Microsoft emails are treated as unverified (so they never link automatically, which prevents
  account takeover through an unverified address). Linking by an explicit "connect account" flow
  is future work.
- **Roles.** `users.role` is `user` or `admin`. Admin comes only from a verified email listed in
  `ADMIN_EMAILS` (a bootstrap, until the admin UI can manage roles). Removing an email does not
  demote automatically.
- **Auth mode is an env var, secure by default.** `AUTH_MODE=jwt` is the default in the API and
  the web app. `AUTH_MODE=stub` keeps the dev stub user for local work without OAuth credentials
  and for tests; it logs a warning at startup, and the staging and production overlays never set it.
  This is wiring, not a code path per environment (rule 1).
- **Failure behaviour.** Missing, malformed, expired or wrongly signed tokens get `401` with
  `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`; the BFF returns `401` when there is no session and middleware sends
  page requests to `/signin`. A token is verified once per request; SSE streams are not
  re-verified while open (the token only has to be valid when the stream starts).
- **Separate OAuth apps per environment** (dev, staging, prod), each with its own redirect URI
  (`<origin>/api/auth/callback/<provider>`).

## Consequences

- New dependencies: `next-auth` v5 and `jose` (web), `PyJWT` (API).
- Songs and runs created under the stub user belong to a user id that no real login maps to; dev
  data from before this change is not visible after switching to `jwt` mode.
- The secret rotation story is simple: replace `API_AUTH_SECRET` on web and API together; tokens
  live five minutes.
- Email verification for non-Google providers, "connect account", sign-in rate limits and abuse
  controls come with the billing and analytics work.
