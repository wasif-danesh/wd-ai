# ADR-0048: Monitoring and alerting

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-10

## Context

Stage 2 of the v1 plan (`docs/roadmap.md`) adds monitoring once the system works end to end on local kind.
What exists today: structured JSON logs with request, trace, tenant and product ids, health endpoints, usage
events in Postgres (billing input, not monitoring), and the convention in `CLAUDE.md` to instrument with
OpenTelemetry, which is not done. There is no metrics endpoint, no dashboard and no alert.

The constraints that decide the design:

- **One operator, a few environments.** Local kind, a private staging box (a 24 GB NVIDIA GPU, reached over
  Tailscale) and a short-lived GCP test that is shut down afterwards. There is no on-call rota; one person must
  hear about a real failure on a phone.
- **Cloud-neutral and open source first** (rules 11 and 12): no Cloud Monitoring, Datadog or other managed or
  proprietary service in platform code.
- **Same images and charts everywhere** (rule 1): environments differ by values only.
- **The things that fail here are specific:** a GPU job that never finishes, a model server that is up but
  answers errors, a queue that stops draining, a volume full of models, a moderation model that is unreachable
  (the run then fails closed, ADR-0047).
- **Private staging cannot be probed from the internet**, and a monitor that lives inside the cluster is blind
  to the cluster itself being down.

## Decision

1. **The monitoring stack runs in the cluster it watches**, in its own `monitoring` namespace, installed from the
   `kube-prometheus-stack` chart: Prometheus (metrics), Alertmanager (routing) and Grafana (dashboards), plus
   Loki for logs. It is cloud-neutral and the same chart serves kind, staging and GCP. Defaults: 15 days of
   metrics, 7 days of logs, small volumes. On kind only Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana run (no Loki), to
   keep the cluster light.
2. **Applications expose metrics.** The API and the media worker serve `/metrics` (Prometheus text format, on
   a separate port for the worker). Metric names are stable and low-cardinality: labels are the product, the
   capability, the outcome and the HTTP route template, **never a user id, a prompt or any content**.
   Initial set:
   - requests: count and latency by route template and status;
   - runs: started and finished by product and outcome (`done`, `refused`, `failed`), refusals by category;
   - jobs: queue depth, jobs by capability and status, duration, GPU seconds, retries;
   - uploads accepted and refused; quota refusals; moderation unavailable (fails closed).
3. **Infrastructure metrics come from standard exporters:** kube-state-metrics and node-exporter (in the chart),
   the NVIDIA DCGM exporter on the GPU host, and Postgres and Redis exporters. Pod and volume usage from the
   kubelet.
4. **Alerts start with about ten rules, each with a runbook line.** Critical (a message at once): API or web
   down; media worker down or the job queue not draining for 10 minutes; Postgres or Redis down; a persistent
   volume above 90%; job failure ratio above 50% for 10 minutes; the language-model gateway unreachable.
   Warning (grouped, not urgent): failure ratio above 20%; a job slower than twice its usual duration; GPU memory
   near full; moderation or quota refusals spiking; certificate or backup problems when those exist.
   More rules are added only when something real is missed.
5. **Notifications go to Telegram** through Alertmanager's native receiver (a bot created with BotFather). The
   bot token is a Kubernetes Secret, never in values or the repository. Critical alerts notify immediately;
   warnings are grouped. WhatsApp (no free official API for alerts, unofficial gateways get banned) and Messenger
   are not used.
6. **One check from outside the cluster.** Prometheus's built-in `Watchdog` alert fires forever by design;
   Alertmanager sends it to an external heartbeat service every minute (Healthchecks.io free tier, or a "push"
   monitor in Uptime Kuma run on another machine). When the heartbeats stop, that service messages Telegram: the
   only way to learn that the whole cluster, or its monitoring, is dead. This works for private staging because
   the cluster pushes out and nothing reaches in.
7. **Not in v1:** Uptime Kuma as a primary monitor, cron-job.org (it needs a public URL, cannot receive
   heartbeats, and mostly emails), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry traces), PagerDuty-style escalation, SLO
   dashboards, and log-based alerting. The first three can be added without changing this design.
8. **Access.** Grafana, Prometheus and Alertmanager have no public ingress. On staging they are reached over
   Tailscale or `kubectl port-forward`; the Grafana admin password comes from a Secret.
9. **Environment differences are values only:** `deploy/helm/monitoring/` holds a base values file and one per
   environment (kind, staging, gcp-test). The application chart gets a `metrics.enabled` switch and the
   `ServiceMonitor` objects.

## Evaluation (the exit criterion for stage 2)

1. On kind, the dashboards show real numbers while `make kind-e2e` runs: runs per product, job durations, queue
   depth.
2. A fire drill on kind: stop the media worker; within 10 minutes the Telegram chat receives the critical alert,
   and it resolves when the worker is back.
3. A second drill: stop Prometheus; within 5 minutes the external heartbeat service messages the same chat.
4. No metric label carries a user id or content (a test scrapes `/metrics` after a run and checks).

## Consequences

- About 1 to 2 GB of memory and a few GB of disk per cluster for the stack; kind in full mode needs it on top
  of the models.
- Two new things to look after: the Telegram bot token (a Secret, rotated by editing it) and the external
  heartbeat account.
- Metrics discipline: any new label must pass the "no user data, bounded values" rule in review.
- Alert fatigue is the failure mode of this design; hence a small rule set that grows from real misses.
- The GCP test gets the same stack from the same values, then everything is removed by `tofu destroy`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Uptime Kuma only:** easy and good for "is it up", but blind to queues, failures and GPU; kept as an optional
  external probe.
- **A managed service (Cloud Monitoring, Datadog, Grafana Cloud):** breaks the cloud-neutral and open-source
  rules, or adds a vendor for a one-person system.
- **VictoriaMetrics or another lighter store:** viable and smaller, but the Prometheus ecosystem (exporters,
  rule examples, the chart) is the common denominator; revisit if memory on staging becomes a problem.
- **Alerts by email only:** too slow for a one-person on-call; Telegram reaches a phone.

## Questions for the owner

1. Is Telegram the only channel? A bot token and a chat id are needed (BotFather, about five minutes).
2. Healthchecks.io's free tier (a hosted heartbeat) or Uptime Kuma on another machine for the outside check?
3. Loki for logs on staging and the GCP test: yes (as proposed), or metrics only for now?
4. Is "no public ingress, reach it over Tailscale" right for Grafana on staging?

## Docs to update if accepted

`docs/roadmap.md` (stage 2 with this design), `docs/architecture.md` (an observability section),
`docs/environments.md`, `docs/configuration.md` (metrics settings), `CLAUDE.md` (the metrics label rule),
a runbook with the fire drills, and the chart READMEs.
