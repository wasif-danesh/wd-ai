"""Prompt enhancement (ADR-0038): rewrite what a user typed into a better prompt for the model.

A product mounts `build_enhance_router(...)` from its own routes. The platform stays generic: the
product says which kinds it has (product.yaml `enhance:`), loads the enhancer instructions from its
own prompts, and supplies the guardrail that must pass on the user's text (and picture) first.

The user's text is data inside a fixed prompt, never instructions, and the result is only text for
the prompt box: the run's own guardrail judges the final prompt again when it is submitted."""
