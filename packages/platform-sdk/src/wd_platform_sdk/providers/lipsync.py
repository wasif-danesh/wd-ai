"""Lip sync on a talking-head server (ADR-0044): a job for the media worker, with no ComfyUI graph.

The request carries the user's picture and voice (`image_key`, `audio_key`, read by the worker from
the user's `uploads/` prefix); the worker sends them to the lip sync server and stores the MP4."""
