"""Product-provided API routes (ADR-0023).

A product can expose read endpoints for its own data (a user's songs, say) next to its graph. It
registers a factory; the API mounts the router under `/products/{product_id}/` and supplies what a
route needs: the identity dependency, the database and storage. Routes must depend on
`deps.identity` (rule 8: no endpoint skips identity) and must scope every query by tenant, product
and user.

        registry.register("my-product", build_graph)
        registry.add_routes("my-product", build_routes)
